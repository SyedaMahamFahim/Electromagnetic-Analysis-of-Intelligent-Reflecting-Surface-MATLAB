# Electromagnetic Analysis of Intelligent Reflecting Surface


Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are a new type of reconfigurable metasurface that
can be used to control the propagation of electromagnetic waves. This paper presents a
MATLAB and Simulink code that can be used to perform the electromagnetic analysis of IRSs.
The code is based on the finite element method and can be used to simulate the propagation of
electromagnetic waves through a variety of IRS configurations. The code is also capable of
generating the reflection coefficients for different incident configurations. The code is validated
by comparing the results of the simulations with the results of analytical calculations. The results
show that the code is able to accurately predict the performance of IRSs.
